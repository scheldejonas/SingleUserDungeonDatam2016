Hall of disaster

There has been a disaster in the world, you where one of the few who survived a huge group escape from the evil world controllers, who derived a lot of people from their homes and denied them food in 30 days, to make them work for building their castles. Your escaped down the sour channel with good luck and is laying here in on floor, trying to find you energy back. Only place to go is south.

You took the south door, and entered The corner for tomorrow

It looks like all the people who came here all walked along the small stepping stones to the right in the floor. But there is a door with a lot of wood covered on it in front, it looks interesting, it has a small lit tourch on it, burning out.

You took the west door, and entered The long hall

There is only a small dim light far far away ahead of you.

You took the west door, and entered Round table

You just entered an opening with the light on a big roundtable infront of you. Room enough for 20 kings or queens. The walls is covered in spiderweb and dust. It's kind of creapy in here. Hurry up south or east, there is openings. But to the north there is a door.
