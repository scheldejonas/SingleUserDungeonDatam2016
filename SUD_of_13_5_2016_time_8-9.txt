Hall of disaster

There has been a disaster in the world, you where one of the few who survived a huge group escape from the evil world controllers, who derived a lot of people from their homes and denied them food in 30 days, to make them work for building their castles. Your escaped down the sour channel with good luck and is laying here in on floor, trying to find you energy back. Only place to go is south.

You took the south door, and entered The corner for tomorrow

It looks like all the people who came here all walked along the small stepping stones to the right in the floor. But there is a door with a lot of wood covered on it in front, it looks interesting, it has a small lit tourch on it, burning out.

You took the west door, and entered The long hall

There is only a small dim light far far away ahead of you.

You took the west door, and entered Round table

You just entered an opening with the light on a big roundtable infront of you. Room enough for 20 kings or queens. The walls is covered in spiderweb and dust. It's kind of creapy in here. Hurry up south or east, there is openings. But to the north there is a door.

You have been attacked by Goblin

A very deep discusting roar from behind is kicking your forward in a roll, hurting your body with scratches and making you bleed a little from your back. Fight your way back out of this room

The monster hit you with 1 damage in it's strike. You have 29 left.

Maybe there is a beautifull item placed behind the monster after you have killed it.

Goblin took 3 damage and died, from your blade.

You picked up Pearl and placed it in your backpack.

A blinking pearl to make you feel happy and a little bit wealthy. it is worth 400 money pieces.

You took the south door, and entered Puke on the walls

Both side walls is covered in puke and it stinks like shit all over! You can only continue south or north.

You took the south door, and entered A big tree is growing from the floor

Wood roots all over in the floor. It looks a tree has been growing through the floor and through the sealing only sticking out some small leaves. you have to continue around the big root foot to the west or north.

You took the west door, and entered Deadbody's covered in autumn leaves all over the floor

Wow, it suddenly became a long hall, with autumn leaves all over! But why. You take the first step and hits something. SHIT it is a deadbody, and realises there is deadbody's sticking out through the leaves all over the hall. You can only jump on top of them, through the hall to the west or east.

You took the east door, and entered A big tree is growing from the floor

Wood roots all over in the floor. It looks a tree has been growing through the floor and through the sealing only sticking out some small leaves. you have to continue around the big root foot to the west or north.

A giant room opens suddenly up. to the south the wall is covered with a big bull carved into the wall with very mean eyes and ring in the noose. You can go to the west, north and east only
